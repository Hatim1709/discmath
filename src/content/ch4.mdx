## References

The following are some references to problem sets which were quite useful to get more practice with number theory. I think some of them were super useful during the exam preparation. In this chapter practice and experience really is the way to go:

- [*250 Problems in elementary number theory* - Sierpinski (1970)](https://www.isinj.com/mt-aime/250%20Problems%20in%20Elementary%20Number%20Theory%20-%20Sierpinski%20(1970).pdf): I would recommend looking at some problems from here and spending some time thinking about them. Obviously some parts of the problem set are not solvable with the knowledge which is relevant for this course (such as part 5 about diophantine equations). However part 1 and 2 are pretty interesting and it turns out that there are some problems in this set which actually occured in exactly like this in old exams - so the style of the exercises matches pretty good.

- [*MATH 312 An Introduction to number theory: problem sets* - University of British Colombia](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~lior/teaching/1718/312_S18/Notes/PracticeSets.pdf): Very nice problem set with interesting exercises. Some of them are a bit out of scope, but the first sections definitly provide good practice to get faster with computations or get an intuition for core proof strategies.

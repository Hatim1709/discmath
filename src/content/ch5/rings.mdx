<Problem title="Alternative Solution Bonus 9a" source="Max Obreiter">
    <div label="question">
        Let $\langle R; +, -, 0, \cdot, 1 \rangle$ be an integral domain; $a, b \in R$ and $n, m \in \mathbb N$. We then define condition $(1)$:
        $$
            \begin{aligned}
                0 < m \le n \land \gcd(m, n) = 1 \land a^m = b^m \land a^n = b^n && (1)
            \end{aligned}
        $$
        Prove that if $(1)$ is satisfied, we have $a = b$.

        Show it without using the fact that there exist $x, y \in \mathbb Z$ s.t. $xm + yn = 1$ holds.

        Assume that $n$ is minimal, then derive a contradiction.

    <div label="answer">
        Note that we already assumed that $m \le n$.

        Assume that this statement was false. Then there must exist a smallest $n$, such that $(1)$ holds but $a \ne b$. We now show that this $n$ can't exist:

        If $m = n$, then by $\gcd(m, n) = 1$, we know that $m = n = 1$ and we get $a = a^1 = b^1 = b$ which is a contradiction to $a \ne b$.

        So assume $0 < m < n$. We then know:
        $$
            \begin{aligned}
                && a^n &= b^n \\
                & \dot\iff & a^m \cdot a^{n - m} &= b^m \cdot b^{n - m} && \text{Def. $r^k$} \\
                & \dot\iff & a^m \cdot a^{n - m} &= a^m \cdot b^{n - m} && a^m = b^m \\
                & \dot\iff & a^m \cdot a^{n - m} - a^m \cdot b^{n - m} &= 0 && -a^m \cdot b^{n - m} \\
                & \dot\iff & a^m \cdot (a^{n - m} - b^{n - m}) &= 0 && \text{Distr. Law}
            \end{aligned}
        $$

        Now we distinguish two cases (either term must be zero because $R$ is an integral domain).

        If $a^m = 0$, then we must have $a = 0 = b^m = b$ (since $R$ has no zerodivisors); a contradiction to $a \ne b$.

        So $a^m \ne 0$, but this means that:
        $$
            \begin{aligned}
                && a^{n - m} - b^{n - m} &= 0 \\
                &\dot\iff & a^{n - m} &= b^{n - m}
            \end{aligned}
        $$

        Since $0 < m < n$ we have $0 < n - m < n$ and $m < n$. Now we can define $m'$ and $n'$:
        $$
            m' = \min(n - m, m) \\ n' = \max(n - m, m)
        $$
        Note that $0 < m' \le n' < n$.

        By Lemma 4.2 we have $\gcd(n, n - m) = gcd(n, m) = 1$. This means that $m'$ and $n'$ satisfy $(1)$.

        And by assumption $a \ne b$; but $n' < n$, which is a contradiction to the assumption that $n$ was minimal!

        Since there is no minimal $n$ for which the statement does not hold, it must hold for all $n$.

        <Callout type="info">
            If we instead continued with $(m', n')$ and continued to apply these steps, we would reach $(1, 1)$, since we are essentially running euclids algorithm in the exponent!

<Problem title="Counting Multiplicative Generators" difficulty={2} relevance={4} source="Yannick Funke">
    <div label="question">
        How many generators does the cyclic group $\mathrm{GF}(3)[x]_{x^3+2 x^2+1}^*$ have?
        Why is the group cyclic in the first place?
    </div>
    <div label="hint">
        Find an useful isomorphism.
    </div>
    <div label="answer">
        From the weekly exercise sheets (ex 10.5) we know that
        $F := \mathrm{GF}(3)[x]_{x^3+2 x^2+1}$ is a field because $x^3+2 x^2+1$ is irreducible.
        Since $|F| = 3^3 = 27$, $|F^*| = | F \setminus \{0\} | = 27 - 1 = 26$.
        By Theorem 5.40 the multiplicative group of a finite field is cyclic.
        Thus $F^*$ must be isomorph to $\mathbb Z_{26}$.
        This implies that both have the same number of generators. By definition
        this is $\varphi(26) = \varphi(2 \cdot 13) = (2-1) \cdot (13-1) = 12$.

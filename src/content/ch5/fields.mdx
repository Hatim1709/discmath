# Fields


<Callout type="info">
We continue our discussion of Rings, but now we require every non-zero element to have an inverse in the multiplicative group and define an algebra fulfilling this new requirement and commutativity a Field (expressed more precisely $F \setminus \{0\} = F^*$). We can directly show that a field must also be an **integral domain**. Why are fields interesting? Well, we can sort of compute normally inside a field (division is defined for all non-zero elements), we could for example execute Gaussian Elimination over arbitrary fields. Next, we continue the discussion of Polynomials. This time over a field: $F[x]$. They are super interesting for many reasons, we will investigate (more precisely they can basically be thought of as an analogon to $\mathbb{Z}$ we have many analog properties (like divisibility, or some notion of primality/irreducibility).
</Callout>


## Theory

### Fields

<Callout type="">
**Definition 5.26** A *field* is a nontrivial ring $F$ in which every nonzero element is a unit i.e. $F^* = F\setminus \{0\}$.
</Callout>

Note that this gives us the possibility to invert every element except for $0$ in the multiplicative group. This means we can sort of divide by every element. Why is this useful? This notion of invertibility gives us powerful tools for example from Linear Algebra. We could for example do Gaussian Elimination over arbitrary fields. Think about why this is not possible over Rings.

<Callout type="">
**Theorem 5.23** $\mathbb{Z}_p$ is a field if and only if $p$ is prime.
</Callout>

This is what we already know from earlier chapters. If $p$ is prime, all elements (except for $0$) are coprime and therefore have an inverse. This is quite interesting because we now have a significant class of fields. Often these are also denoted by $GF(p)$ (Galois Field).

<Callout type="">
**Theorem 5.24** Every field is an integral domain
</Callout>
This should be quite intuitive and the proof is quite fast: assume that $uv = 0$, then $v = u^{-1}uv = u^{-1} 0 = 0$. What we are doing here is, because of the invertibility, we can simply *solve* $uv = 0$ for $u$ or $v$ and obtain that at least one of them must be $0$.


---

What is the takeaway here? Remember Fields are special commutative Rings (people often forget commutativity here), in which we can sort of divide by every non-zero element. Also, think about why it does not make sense to require $0$ to be invertible and what would follow in this case. So we are actually sort of requiring the maximal number of nice things (invertible elements), we could possibly have.

### Polynomials over Fields

In the last chapter, we considered polynomials over Rings. Now we want to combine this with our *new notion* of a **field**. Namely, we consider Polynomials over Fields: $F[x]$ (where $F$ is a field). Intuitively, think about what this gives us. We can now invert all the non-zero coefficients of the polynomials. Actually, this property is super strong, we will see that we can now define many things we know from the Integers $\mathbb{Z}$ (division, gcd, etc...). Note however, $F[x]$ is still a ring, because it is impossible to invert any element that is non-constant (we can only increase the degree by multiplying with another polynomial). From the last chapter we classified elements as zero-divisor, units, zero (this worked for finite integral domains: we know that in a finite integral domain, every element belongs to one of the three classes). However, now we are in infinite integral domains (*why is $F[x]$ an integral domain?*), therefore this classification will not work anymore. We will come back to it later though.

For the infinite case (i.e. $\mathbb{Z}$) we were able to classify the elements as a unit, zero, composite, and prime. We can actually do the same thing for the infinite case $F[x]$. Really just think about $F[x]$ in the same way you think about $\mathbb{Z}$. 

<Callout type="">
**Definition 5.27** A polynomial $a(x) \in F[x]$ is called *monic* if the leading coefficient is $1$. 
</Callout>

Why do we care about this definition? Well, because of the invertibility of the field elements, we obtain that if $a(x)$ divides $b(x)$ (i.e. $a(x) \cdot c(x) = b(x)$) then also $v a(x)$ divides $b(x)$ for any $v \in F$ (because $v a(x) \cdot v^{-1} c(x) = b(x)$). So if one polynomial divides another then sort of $|F^*|$ polynomials (all multiples of this polynomial) will also divide the other. We had a similar problem in $\mathbb{Z}$. If $2 \mid 4$, then we could multiply the divisor with $-1$ or $1$ and $-2 \mid 4$ and $2 \mid 4$. We just discovered something very interesting. In $\mathbb{Z}$ the only invertible elements were $-1$ and $1$. In $F[x]$ the only invertible elements are all the constant non-zero polynomials. For example:

$$
GF(5)[x]^* = \{1,2,3,4\}
$$ 

So for a divisor, we can sort of think of an equivalence class of divisors with respect the multiplying it by a unit (in $\mathbb{Z}$ the units were $-1$ and $1$, so we had equivalence classes of size $2$, now we have equivalence classes of size $|F^*|$). We always picked one element from the equivalence class as some *distinguished* element (for example when saying $\gcd(4,6) = 2$, we picked $2$ and not $-2$). We want to do the same thing for our polynomials. To establish this notion, we always pick the monic polynomial from the equivalence class (note that the leading coefficient is different for every unit with which we multiply the divisor, so there is only one monic polynomial in every equivalence class of divisors). 

---

We just made major observations about the similarities of $\mathbb{Z}$ and $F[x]$. I would like to go into more detail about it (see [Euclidean Domains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_domain)). We will later see that what we did for $\mathbb{Z}$ to generate Rings and fields using modular arithmetic, works exactly the same way for $F[x]$ (we were able to generate fields with $\mathbb{Z}_p$, where $p$ is prime, how are we able to generate fields with $F[x]_{m(x)}$?). This is what we will explore next. 


#### Division \& Irreducibility

As we already discussed the similarity between $\mathbb{Z}$ and $F[x]$, it should not come as a surprise to you, that we can also have some notion of primality. 

<Callout type="">
**Definition 5.28** A polynomial $a(x) \in F[x]$ with degree at least $1$ is called *irreducible* if it is divisible only by constant polynomials and by constant multiples of $a(x)$.
</Callout>

So here we are introducing the definition of *primality* of polynomials. We can now classify all the elements of $F[x]$. Either zero (only $0 \in F[x]$), unit (only all non-zero constant polynomials), reducible and irreducible polynomials.

Note that every polynomial of degree one is irreducible directly by definition.

<Callout type="">
**Definition 5.29** The monic polynomial $g(x)$ of largest degree such that $g(x) \mid  a(x)$ and $g(x) \mid b(x)$ is called the greatest common divisor of $a(x)$ and $b(x)$ and is denoted by $\gcd(a(x),b(x))$
</Callout>

Just the same as in $\mathbb{Z}$. We can now also think about how we would compute this. Just apply the Euclidean algorithm!


<Callout type="">
**Theorem 5.25** Let $F$ be a field. For any $a(x)$ and $b(x) \neq 0$ in $F[x]$ there exists a unique $q(x)$ and a unique $r(x)$ (with $\deg r(x) < \deg b(x)$) such that 
$$
a(x) = b(x) \cdot q(x) + r(x) 
$$
</Callout>

See the later section on polynomial division. I think the best thing to get intuition here is to practice polynomial division. Intuitively, it is the same as for $\mathbb{Z}$. We cannot pull anymore $b(x)$'s out of $r(x)$ if $\deg r(x) < \deg b(x)$. 

Now, as we introduced this, we could introduce everything we know about modular arithmetic to $F[x]_{m(x)}$ which now means modulo the polynomial $m(x)$. We can think about the remainders and stuff :).  

#### Polynomials as Functions

Before, we considered polynomials as abstract objects. Basically, we didn't care about the $x$ in the polynomial it was just some symbol to simplify the operations we can perform. We could also just treat the polynomials as lists of numbers and some special operation (this would be a [discrete convolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution) between the two lists instead of multiplication and elementwise addition for addition). However, now we want to combine the real notion of polynomials (by reconsidering what we can do with the $x$ and what we couldn't do with a list of numbers - well we could just think of the list of numbers as a polynomial). 

<Callout type="">
**Definition 5.33**  Let $a(x) \in R[x]$. An element $\alpha \in R$ for which $a(\alpha) = 0$ is called a root of $a(x)$. 
</Callout>

The following Lemma is probably the most important in this section. It combines the previous way we thought about divisibility and stuff (considering the similarity of $F[x]$ and $\mathbb{Z}$) with the things we can do when evaluating polynomials.

<Callout type="">
**Lemma 5.29**  For a field $F$, $\alpha \in F$ is a root of $a(x)$ if and only if $x-\alpha$ divides $a(x)$
</Callout>

<Callout type="">
**Corollary 5.20** A polynomial $a(x)$ of degree $2$ or $3$ over a field $F$ is irreducible if and only if it has no root.
</Callout>

The above Corollary will be one of the most important irreducibility checks you will use. 


#### Polynomial Interpolation


### Finite Fields

So we discussed different properties of Fields and Polynomials over Fields. What stood out is that $\mathbb{Z}$ and $F[x]$ are very similar Rings. We were able to create Fields $\mathbb{Z}_p$ for $p$ prime and now we are interested in creating so-called extension fields (which is just a special term, it is nothing else but a field) from $F[x]_{m(x)}$ (we actually haven't defined this notation yet):

<Callout type="">
**Lemma 5.33** Congruence modulo $m(x)$ is an equivalence relation on $F[x]$ and each equivalence class has a unique representation of degree less than $\deg(m(x))$
</Callout>

<Callout type="">
**Definition 5.34** Let $m(x)$ be a polynomial of degree $d$ over $F$. Then 

$$
F[x]_{m(x)} = \{a(x) \in F[x] \mid \deg(a(x)) < d\}
$$
</Callout>

The degree will always be kept smaller than $d$ because otherwise, we could divide by $m(x)$.

<Callout type="">
**Lemma 5.34** Let $F$ be a finite field with $q$ elements and let $m(x)$ be a polynomial of degree $d$ over $F$. Then $|F[x]_{m(x)}| = q^d$. 
</Callout>

We can think of the polynomials again of lists of numbers, because are compute modulo $m(x)$ every list has $d$ entries (for terms from order $0$ to $d-1$). For each of the entries, we have $q$ choices of elements from the field, so overall $q^d$ different $d$-Tuples.


<Callout type="">
**Lemma 5.35** $F[x]_{m(x)}$ is a ring with respect to addition and multiplication modulo $m(x)$. 
</Callout>

This should not come as a surprise as $\mathbb{Z}_m$ were also Rings.


<Callout type="">
**Lemma 5.36** The congruence equation:
$$
a(x)b(x) \equiv_{m(x)} 1
$$
has a solution if and only if $\gcd(a(x),b(x)) = 1$. We define:

$$
F[x]_{m(x)}^* = \{a(x) \in F[x]_{m(x)} \mid \gcd(a(x), m(x)) = 1\}
$$
</Callout>
This is exactly what we did for $\mathbb{Z}_m^*$.

How can we classify the elements from $F[x]_{m(x)}$? We can do the same as for $\mathbb{Z}$: zero, zero-divisors, units. 

There is more to come here...

## Tips and Tricks

### How to check irreducibility of a polynomial?

Intuitively, this is the same problem as checking whether an integer is a prime number.

We cite the part of the script here, as this explanation is perfect:

>It follows immediately from the definition (and from the fact that the degrees are added when polynomials are multiplied) that every polynomial of degree $1$ is irreducible. Moreover, a polynomial of degree $2$ is either irreducible or the product of two polynomials of degree $1$. A polynomial of degree $3$ is either irreducible or has at least one factor of degree $1$ (which is equivalent to being a root). Similarly, a polynomial of degree $4$ is either irreducible, has a factor of degree $1$, or has an irreducible factor of degree $2$.
> Irreducibility of a polynomial of degree $d$ can be checked by testing all irreducible polynomials of degree $\leq d/2$ as possible divisors. Actually, it suffices to test only the monic polynomials because one could always multiply a divisor by a constant, for example, the inverse of the highest coefficient. This irreducibility test is very similar to the primality test which checks all divisors up to the square root of the number to be tested.

Really try to understand every claim in the paragraph above!

In most cases, you will have to verify the irreducibility of degree 2 or 3. In this case, just plug in all the elements from your field and try to find roots (verify by showing that they indeed evaluate to $0$).

For degree $d > 3$, it is often more work as stated above. Here, really think about the analogy to $\mathbb{Z}$. You want to check for some number whether it is prime or not. What you do is try all prime numbers up to $\sqrt{n}$ to divide the number. The same applies to polynomials. 


<Callout type='info'>
There are some tricks to quickly deduce the non-irreducibility of a polynomial over $GF(2)$. Namely, the following two:

1. Let $p(x) \in GF(2)[x]$ such that $\deg(p) \geq 2$ if there is no constant term, then the polynomial is reducible. This is simply because we obtain quickly that $0$ is a root, thus the polynomial is divisible by $x$. This is actually true for polynomials over any field.

2. Let $p(x) \in GF(2)[x]$ such that $\deg(p) \geq 2$, if there is an even number of terms overall, then the polynomial is reducible. This is simply because we directly obtain $0$ when plugging in $1$, because all the terms will evaluate to $1$ and there is an even number of terms, so we obtain that $1$ is a root.
</Callout>

### How to prove that something is a field?

To prove that $F$ we technically have to go by definition, i.e. show that it is a **commutative nontrivial Ring** with $F \setminus \{0\} = F^*$. This would be very annoying because we would have to verify a big list of requirements and then even show that every non-zero element is a unit. This is why you will probably most often use one of the following theorems:

1. **Thm. 5.23.** $\mathbb{Z}_p$ is a field if and only if $p$ is prime (because this is a rather trivial task, it will probably not be an exercise, however, it might be an important first step to notice this for other proofs)
2. **Thm. 5.37.** $F[x]_{m(x)}$ is a field if and only if $m(x)$ is irreducible. Here we have to check irreducibility of $m(x)$ (see above).


#### Example


<Problem title="Proving that something is a Field (old bonus)" difficulty={1} relevance={4} source={"Tobias Steinbrecher"}>
<div label="question">
Prove that $GF(5)[x]_{x^2 + 4x + 1}$ is a field.
</div>
<div label="answer">

Note that $5$ is a prime number. With Theorem 5.23 we obtain that $\mathbb{Z}_5$ is a field.
 To prove that $F = \mathbb{Z}_5[x]_{x^2+4x+1}$ is a field, we can use Theorem 5.37. We can show that $x^2+4x+1$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Z}_5$ and then apply Theorem 5.37 to obtain that  $F = \mathbb{Z}_5[x]_{x^2+4x+1}$ is a field.
To prove that $x^2+4x+1$  over $\mathbb{Z}_5$ is irreducible, we can apply Corollary 5.30. We have to show that $x^2+4x+1$ has no roots in $\mathbb{Z}_5$. Let $m(x) = x^2+4x+1$. We can deduce irreducibility because $m(x)$ is of degree $2$ and thus, at least one divisor would need to be of degree $1$.
By definition of a root, $\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}_5$ is a root of $m(x)$ if $m(\alpha) = 0$. As there are finite possibilities for $\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}_5$, namely $5$, we can try them all:

| $\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}_5$ | $m(\alpha)$                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| $0$                       | $m(0) = R_5(0^2 + 4\cdot 0 + 1)= 1 \neq 0 \implies$ not a root (definition 5.33) |
| $1$                       | $m(1) = R_5(1^2 + 4\cdot 1 + 1)= 1 \neq 0 \implies$ not a root (definition 5.33) |
| $2$                       | $m(2) = R_5(2^2 + 4\cdot 2 + 1)= 3 \neq 0 \implies$ not a root (definition 5.33) |
| $3$                       | $m(3) = R_5(3^2 + 4\cdot 3 + 1)= 2 \neq 0 \implies$ not a root (definition 5.33) |
| $4$                       | $m(4) = R_5(4^2 + 4\cdot 4 + 1)= 3 \neq 0 \implies$ not a root (definition 5.33) |

As there is no $\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}_5$ such that $m(\alpha) = 0$, i.e. there is no root, we obtain with Corollary 5.30, that $m(x) = x^2 + 4x + 1$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Z}_5$. Therefore, with Theorem 5.37, $F = \mathbb{Z}_5[x]_{x^2+4x+1}$ is a field.

<Problem title="Proving that something is a Generator (old bonus)" difficulty={1} relevance={4} source={"Tobias Steinbrecher"}>
<div label="question">
Prove that $\langle x+3 \rangle = GF(5)[x]_{x^2 + 4x + 1}^*$ (given that $F = GF(5)[x]_{x^2 + 4x + 1}$ is a field).
</div>
<div label="answer">
*Note that I will use $=$ between polynomials, respecting that the coefficients are in $\mathbb{Z}_5$. Therefore, something like $4x + 3x = 2x$ will be used such that no coefficient bigger than $4$ will appear (instead of stating explicitly that the coefficients are congruent modulo $5$). However, I will still use $R_{m(x)}(...)$ or $\equiv_{m(x)}$ to make explicit that I consider the remainder modulo the polynomial $m(x)$.*

With Lemma 5.34, we obtain that $|F| = 5^2 = 25$ (because $|\mathbb{Z}_5| = 5$ and $\deg(x^2+4x+1) = 2$). As $F$ is a field, we obtain by definition 5.26: $F^* = F \setminus \{0\}$, where $0$ denotes the $0$ polynomial (neutral element of addition). Therefore, we have $|F^*| = |F| - 1 = 24$.  

By Corollary 5.9, we obtain that the order of every element $a \in F^*$ divides $|F^*|$.  
Hence, $\text{ord}(a) \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24\}$ for every $a \in F^*$. We know that if $\text{ord}(x+3) = 24$, then $x+3$ is a generator (which is what we want to prove). This follows directly from the fact that definition 5.14 implies that $|\langle a \rangle| = \text{ord}(a)$ for an arbitrary $a$. Hence, if we want to have $\langle a \rangle = F^*$, we need $\text{ord}(a) = |F^*|$. Hence, we can simply prove that $\text{ord}(x+3) \notin \{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12\}$ such that we obtain $\text{ord}(x+3) = 24$ directly.  

We will do so by showing that $(x+3)^n \neq 1$ (neutral element of multiplication in $F^*$) for all $n \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12\}$. By definition of the order, we obtain that $n$ cannot be the order in the corresponding case. Let $m(x) = x^2 + 4x + 1$ (the modulus for the group operation). We will use the properties of modular arithmetic implicitly (the remainder modulo $m(x)$ can be calculated at any intermediate step, see Corollary 4.17).

1. **$n = 1$** As $(x+3)^1 = (x+3) \neq 1$, we have $\text{ord}(x+3) \neq 1$.

2. **$n = 2$**  We have:
   $$
   \begin{aligned}
       (x+3)^2 &\equiv_{m(x)} R_{m(x)}(x^2 + x + 4) \\
       &= R_{m(x)}((x^2 + 4x + 1) + 2x + 3) \\
       &= 2x + 3 \quad (\in F^{*}) \\
       &\neq 1
   \end{aligned}
   $$
   Therefore, $\text{ord}(x+3) \neq 2$.

3. **$n = 3$**  
   We have:
   $$
   \begin{aligned}
       (x+3)^3 &= (x+3)(x+3)^2 \\
       &\equiv_{m(x)} (x+3)(2x+3) \quad \text{(previous result)} \\
       &\equiv_{m(x)} R_{m(x)}(2x^2 + 4x + 4) \\
       &= R_{m(x)}(2(x^2 + 4x + 1) + x + 2) \\
       &= x + 2 \quad (\in F^{*}) \\
       &\neq 1
   \end{aligned}
   $$
   Therefore, $\text{ord}(x+3) \neq 3$.

4. **$n = 4$**  
   We have:
   $$
   \begin{aligned}
       (x+3)^4 &= (x+3)^2(x+3)^2 \\
       &\equiv_{m(x)} (2x+3)^2 \quad \text{(previous result)} \\
       &\equiv_{m(x)} R_{m(x)}(4x^2 + 2x + 4) \\
       &= R_{m(x)}(4(x^2 + 4x + 1) + x) \\
       &= x \quad (\in F^{*}) \\
       &\neq 1
   \end{aligned}
   $$
   Therefore, $\text{ord}(x+3) \neq 4$.

5. **$n = 6$**  
   We have:

   $$
   \begin{aligned}
       (x+3)^6 &= ((x+3)^3)^2 \\
       &\equiv_{m(x)} (x+2)^2 \quad \text{(previous result)} \\
       &\equiv_{m(x)} R_{m(x)}(x^2 + 4x + 4) \\
       &= R_{m(x)}((x^2 + 4x + 1) + 3) \\
       &= 3 \quad (\in F^*) \\
       &\neq 1
   \end{aligned}
   $$

   Therefore, $\text{ord}(x+3) \neq 6$.

6. **$n = 8$**  
   We have:

   $$
   \begin{aligned}
       (x+3)^8 &= ((x+3)^4)^2 \\
       &\equiv_{m(x)} x^2 \quad \text{(previous result)} \\
       &\equiv_{m(x)} R_{m(x)}(x^2) \\
       &= R_{m(x)}((x^2 + 4x + 1) + x + 4) \\
       &= x+4 \quad (\in F^*) \\
       &\neq 1
   \end{aligned}
   $$
   
   Therefore, $\text{ord}(x+3) \neq 8$.

7. **$n = 12$**  
   We have:
   $$
   \begin{aligned}
       (x+3)^{12} &= ((x+3)^6)^2 \\
       &\equiv_{m(x)} 3^2 \quad \text{(previous result)} \\
       &\equiv_{m(x)} R_{m(x)}(4) \\
       &= 4 \quad (\in F^*) \\
       &\neq 1
   \end{aligned}
   $$
   Therefore, $\text{ord}(x+3) \neq 12$.

Because we were able to eliminate the possibilities $1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12$ as orders for $x+3 \in F^*$, we obtain by the argument above that $x+3$ has order $24$ and thus is a generator of $F^*$. We have $\langle x+3 \rangle = F^*$.

    </div>
    <div label="answer">
        Define $R = \mathrm{GF}(p)[x]_{x^m}$.

        In the following we will show that, for any $a(x) \in R$ we have that $\gcd(a(x), x^m) \neq 1 \iff x|a(x)$.

        Let $a(x) \in R$ be arbitrary.

        We first show $\implies$: Assume $\gcd(a(x), x^m) \eqqcolon g(x) \neq 1$. Then we have that $g(x) \vert x^m$, by definition. This implies that we have $g(x)b(x) = x^m$ for some $b(x) \in \mathrm{GF}(p)[x]$. Note that by definition $g(x)$ has to be monic and since $g(x) \neq 1$ we have that $g(x)$ is not constant. Note that by Theorem 5.27 (unique factorization of elements over Euclidean Domains) we need that $g(x) = x^d$ with $0 \leq d \leq m$ since $x$ is irreducible in $\mathrm{GF}(p)[x]$ and we have that degrees of polynomials are added for polynomials on integral domains and a field is in particular an integral domain and $g(x)$ is monic. As $g(x)$ is not constant we have that $1 \leq d \leq m$. Note that this means that $x \vert g(x)$. Since $g(x) \vert a(x)$ by transitivity of $\vert$ we obtain that $x \vert a(x)$.

        For the other direction "$\impliedby$" we have $x | a(x) \implies x | \gcd(a(x), x^m) \implies \gcd(a(x), x^m) \neq 1$.

        Using Lemma 5.36 we find $R^* = \{ a(x) \in R \text{ | } \gcd(a(x), x^m)=1 \} = \{ a(x) \in R \text{ | } x \nmid a(x) \}$.

        Now we determine the order of

        \begin{aligned}
        \{ a(x) \in R \text{ | } x | a(x) \} &= \{ x b(x) \in R \text{ | } b(x) \in R \} \\
        &= \{ x b(x) \text{ | } b(x) \in R \land \mathrm{deg}(b(x)) \lt m - 1 \}
        \end{aligned}
        $$

        The last equality holds since in an integral $deg(xb) = deg(x) + deg(b) = 1 + deg(b)$.
        Since $\mathrm{GF}(p)$ is a field, it is also an integral domain and so is $\mathrm{GF}(p)[x]$.

        Therefore
        $$
        \begin{aligned}
        \left| \mathrm{GF}(p)[x]_{x^m}^*\right|
        &= \left| R \setminus \{ a(x) \in R \text{ | } x \mid a(x) \} \right|
         \\&= \left| R \setminus \{ x b(x) \mid b(x) \in R \land \mathrm{deg}(b(x)) \lt m - 1 \} \right| \\
        &= p^m - p^{m-1} = p^{m-1}(p-1) \\
        &= \varphi(p^{m}) \\
        \end{aligned}
        $$

        Caution: Note that showed that only in this special case the order of the multiplicative group evaluates to $\varphi(|R|)$.

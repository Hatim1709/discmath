# General Information

Welcome to **Discrete Mathematics**. <br/>
You will find the material organized chapter-wise, similar to the [official script](https://crypto.ethz.ch/teaching/DM24/ln/DM24_LN.pdf), for each chapter we have subsections for the corresponding weeks. Please read the script - probably the best advice in this course!
Some weeks include exercises and problems that we have created ourselves. If you find any mistakes or inaccuracies in the content, please reach out to us. You can also create issues or pull requests on GitHub.

- [Abstract Algebra: Theory and Applications - Thomas W. Judson](https://judsonbooks.org/aata-files/aata-20240706.pdf): *This book is incredible helpful for finding nice exercises. It also provides a lot of detail for topics which are not covered in this course and I think you can really gain intuition about different topics of algebra by going through some pages/chapters. Especially the group theory chapters are super interesting.*

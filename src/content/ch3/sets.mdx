# The most basic object

In mathematics, a set constitutes the most basic object. We define
a mathematical object by the properties of the operations we can perform on it.

In the case of sets, we only have a single operation: the membership predicate takes two
sets and maps them to a truth value. In infix notation:
$$
x \in A \\
x \notin A \iff \neg (x \in A)
$$

Finite sets can be written by enumerating their elements:
$$
\{ A, B, C \}
$$

<Callout type="warning" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  When enumerating sets, the order of elements does not matter. Elements
  can be repeated without an effect:
    $$ \{ A, B, C \} = \{ A, C, B \} = \{ A, B, C, A \} $$
</Callout>

In the following, we define some shorthand notation and some properties
of the membership predicate. If you want a more formal treatment of set theory
have a look at the
[Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory).

<Callout type='axiom'>
1. **Empty set**: There exists an empty set, usually denoted as $\emptyset$.
    $$
    \forall x \neg (x \in \emptyset)
    $$
3. **Subset**:
    $$
    \begin{align*}
    A \subseteq B &\iff \forall x (x \in A \to x \in B) \\
    A \subset B &\iff A \subseteq B \land A \neq B \\
    \end{align*}
    $$
2. **Equality**:
    $$
    \begin{align*}
    A = B &\iff \forall x (x \in A \leftrightarrow x \in B) \\
            &\iff A \subseteq B \land B \subseteq A
    \end{align*}
    $$
3. **Axiom of pairing**: For any sets $A, B$ there exists a set $\{A, B\}$.
4. **Union**: For any sets $A, B$ there exists a set $A \cup B$. Defined as:
    $$
    x \in A \cup B \iff x \in A \lor x \in B
    $$
5. **Intersection**: For any sets $A, B$ there exists a set $A \cap B$. Defined as:
    $$
    x \in A \cap B \iff x \in A \land x \in B
    $$
6. **Difference**: For any sets $A, B$ there exists a set $A \setminus B$. Defined as:
    $$
    x \in A \setminus B \iff x \in A \land x \notin B
    $$
6. **Filter**: For any predicate $P$ and set $A$ there exists a set containing all
the elements of $A$ for which $P$ holds. In set notation:
    $$
    \{ x \in A \mid P(x) \}
    $$
7.  **Power set**: For any set $A$ there exists a set $\mathcal{P}(A)$ containing all subsets of $A$.
    $$
    x \in \mathcal{P}(A) \iff x \subseteq A
    $$

<Problem title="Existance of Singletons" source="Max Obreiter">
      <div label="question">
        Prove that for any set $A$ there exists a set $\{ A \}$ containing only $A$.
      </div>
      <div label="hint">Make use of the Axiom of Pairing.</div>
      <div label="answer">
        The Axiom of Pairing doesn't state that $A$ and $B$ have to be different.
        We can use the Axiom of Pairing to create a set containing $A$ and $A$:
        $$
        \{ A, A \}
        $$
        By the definition of equality, we can see that this set is equal to $\{ A \}$.

# Introduction to logic
As you probably realized while reading this chapter in the script—*if you haven't, please read the script first*—this chapter introduces the concept of **logical thinking**, including **statements** and **proofs** (including **proof patterns**), as well as two *types of logic*: **propositional logic** and **predicate logic**. The references to the more formal approach in Chapter 6 are justified; however, this initial introduction is crucial for understanding the subsequent chapters and concepts.

There are a few common questions that arise in this chapter. While some of these should become clear upon rereading the script, we will elaborate on them here.

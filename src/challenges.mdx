<Problem title="Equivalence Relation on Vector Spaces" source="Tobias Steinbrecher">
  <div label="question">
    Let $V$ be a real vector space, and define a relation $\sim$ on $V$ as follows: For $u, v \in V$, we say $u \sim v$ if and only if $u - v \in W$, where $W$ is a subspace of $V$. Prove that this relation is an equivalence relation.
  </div>
  <div label="hint">
    To prove that $\sim$ is an equivalence relation, you need to verify that it satisfies the three properties of equivalence relations: reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity. For reflexivity, consider $u - u$. For symmetry, think about how $u - v$ relates to $v - u$. For transitivity, check how the condition $u - v \in W$ and $v - w \in W$ combine.
  </div>
  <div label="answer">
    We need to prove that the relation $u \sim v$ (i.e., $u - v \in W$) is an equivalence relation. This requires verifying three properties: reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity.

    **1. Reflexivity**:  
    For any $u \in V$, we have:
    $$
    u - u = 0
    $$
    Since $W$ is a subspace, $0 \in W$. Therefore, $u \sim u$, and the relation is reflexive.

    **2. Symmetry**:  
    Suppose $u \sim v$, which means $u - v \in W$. We need to show that $v \sim u$. Since $u - v \in W$ and $W$ is a subspace, we know that $-(u - v) = v - u \in W$ (because subspaces are closed under scalar multiplication by $-1$). Therefore, $v \sim u$, and the relation is symmetric.

    **3. Transitivity**:  
    Suppose $u \sim v$ and $v \sim w$, meaning $u - v \in W$ and $v - w \in W$. We need to show that $u \sim w$. Since $W$ is a subspace and is closed under addition, we have:
    $$
    (u - v) + (v - w) = u - w \in W
    $$
    Therefore, $u \sim w$, and the relation is transitive.

    Since the relation is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive, $\sim$ is an equivalence relation.

<Problem title="Two be or not two be" difficulty={5} relevance={0} source="Yannick Funke, Max Obreiter">
    <div label="question">
        *Prove the following statement*:
        $$
            \left| \mathbb N / \! \equiv_2 \right| = 2
        $$

        You are **NOT** allowed to use:
        - Proof by Induction
        - Results from Chapter 4 and 5 unless explicitely allowed

        Assume the following:
        - The universe is $U = \mathbb Z$
        - The binary functions $\cdot, +, -$ and the unary function $-$ are defined as usual. You can also use the properties of these functions (e.g. distributivity, etc.).
        - The predicates $\le$ and $=$ are defined as usual. You can also use the properties of the combination of these predicates and the functions (e.g. the order axioms).
        - $(\mathbb N; \le)$ is well-ordered
        - $a \equiv_2 b \overset{\small def}{\Longleftrightarrow} \exists k (2k = a - b)$

        This challenge is very difficult, so don't worry if you need to look at the hints!

        There are multiple ways to prove this statement, the hint/answer show the intended way.
    </div>
    <div label="hint">
        Prove the following statement (for $U = \mathbb N$):
        $$
            \forall n \exists c \left[ c \le 1 \land n \equiv_2 c ) \right]
        $$
    </div>
    <div label="hint">
        Prove it by contradiction (it's a little bit trickier than usual, see the next hint for more help). You might want to prove $m \equiv_2 m - 2$ first.
    </div>
    <div label="hint">
        Assume that $c \ge 2$ is the smallest natural number such that $m \equiv_2 c$ and show that $c$ is actually not minimal. You might want to use the well-ordering principle here.

    <div label="hint">
        Conclude that $\left| \mathbb N / \! \equiv_2 \right| \le 2$.
    </div>
    <div label="hint">
        Show that $\left| \mathbb N / \! \equiv_2 \right| \ge 2$. This should be easier.
    </div>
    <div label="hint">
        Show that a set with two elements is a subset of $\mathbb N / \! \equiv_2$. Then conclude that $\left| \mathbb N / \! \equiv_2 \right| = 2$.
    </div>
    <div label="answer">
        We first prove that $m \equiv_2 m - 2$ for some arbitrary but fixed $m \in \mathbb Z$:
        $$
            \begin{aligned}
                m \equiv_2 m - 2 &\overset{\text{def}}{\Longleftrightarrow} \exists k (2k = m - (m - 2)) \\
                \dot\Longleftrightarrow & \exists k (2k = 2) \\
                \dot\Longleftrightarrow & \exists k (k = 1) \\
                \dot\Longleftrightarrow & \top
            \end{aligned}
        $$

        Now we prove that for any fixed but arbitrary natrual number $n \in \mathbb N$ the following holds:
        $$
            \exists c \in \mathbb N \; \left( c \le 1 \land n \equiv_2 c \right)
        $$
        We prove this by contradiction. Assume that the smallest such $c \in [n]_{\equiv_2}$ is $c \ge 2$ (for the fixed $n$). Because $n \in [n]_{\equiv_2}$, we have $[n]_{\equiv_2} \ne \varnothing$, so by the well-ordering principle there exists a least element $c \in [n]_{\equiv_2}$. Then we have:
        $$
            \begin{aligned}
                n &\equiv_2 c && \text{Def. of $c$} \\
                &\equiv_2 c - 2 && \text{Proved above} \\
            \end{aligned}
        $$
        Since $c \ge 2 \iff c - 2 \ge 0$, we have $(c - 2) \in \mathbb N$. This means that $(c - 2) \in [n]_{\equiv_2}$ as proven previously and $c \ge c - 2$, which is a contradiction to the minimality of $c$. Therefore, $c \le 1$.
        This implies that $\left| \mathbb N / \! \equiv_2 \right| \le 2$. 

        Now we show that $\left| \mathbb N / \! \equiv_2 \right| \ge 2$. We show that by proving that $[0]_{\equiv_2} \ne [1]_{\equiv_2}$, i.e. $0 \not\equiv_2 1$.
        Assume that $0 \equiv_2 1$. Then we have:
        $$
            \begin{aligned}
                & 0 \equiv_2 1 \\
                \dot\Longrightarrow & \exists k (2k = 1) && \text{Def. of $\equiv_2$} \\
            \end{aligned}
        $$

        We distinguish two cases:
        - If $k \ge 1$, then $2k \ge 2$, which is a contradiction to $2k = 1$.
        - If $k \le 0$, then $2k \le 0$, which is a contradiction to $2k = 1$.
        
        Since the two cases cover all possibilities, we have shown that $0 \not\equiv_2 1$ and thus $[0]_{\equiv_2} \ne [1]_{\equiv_2}$.

        This means that $\left\{ [0]_{\equiv_2}, [1]_{\equiv_2} \right\} \subseteq (\mathbb N / \! \equiv_2)$, which implies that $\left| \mathbb N / \! \equiv_2 \right| \ge 2$.

        By the anti-symmetry of $\le$ (and $\ge$), we have $\left| \mathbb N / \! \equiv_2 \right| = 2$.

<Problem title="Ueli's Security Agency" source="chopingu, Tobias Steinbrecher">
  <div label="question">
Alice and Bob are top operatives of rival intelligence agencies. Despite their rivalry, a crisis has forced them to collaborate. They want to securely communicate using their only shared secret $m$, a critical code that unlocks a ton of sensitive information essential to global catastrophe. You know the two public keys of the two organizations $a$ and $b$. Because they are rivals, $a$ and $b$ are obviously coprime.
Both Alice and Bob already know $m$, but they need to ensure its secrecy during the exchange. Unfortunately, years of rivalry and agency-specific training have left Alice and Bob with incompatible cryptographic practices. Their instructions mistakenly consist of elements of RSA and Diffie-Hellman protocols, leading to a flawed scheme, which makes it possible for you to intercept $A = R_p(m^a)$ and $B = R_p(m^b)$ for some big prime $p$ also known to you (such that $m < p < \min(m^a, m^b)$).
A third party, USA (Ueli's Security Agency), hires you.
How could you recover $m$?

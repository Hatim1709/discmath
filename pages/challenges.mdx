# Challenges

The first student enrolled in Discrete Mathematics 2025 who sends a sophisticated proof to [submit@discmath.ch](mailto:submit@discmath.ch) will be compensated with a sweet treat in their next exercise session - be honest and don't use external tools :). 

Please check that this challenge is unsolved before sending in your solutions.

<Problem
title="Pigeonhole Party"
difficulty={3}
relevance={2}
source="Leo Schmidt-Traub"
>
<div label="question">
Six mathematicians attend a party. Any two mathematicians either both know each other or both don't know each other. Prove that there must be a group of at least three mathematicians that either all know or all don\'t know each other.
</div>
<div label="hint">
Use the pigeonhole principle.
</div>
<div label="answer">
The question can be formulated as a graph coloring problem: let the mathematicians be the vertices of a complete graph of size 6. Color the edge between two mathematicians red if they know each other, otherwise black. We now wish to prove the existence of a monochromatic triangle in this graph.

Consider an arbitrary vertex $v$ in the graph. $v$ has $5$ edges, which means at least $\left\lceil\frac{5}{2}\right\rceil=3$ of its edges share a color. W.l.o.g., assume they are colored red. Now consider the three vertices these edges lead to. We distinguish 2 cases: 
- If any edge between these three vertices is red, we have our triangle.
- Otherwise, all edges between said vertices are black, which also gives us a monochromatic triangle.

By case distinction, such a triangle must exist.

## Week 4

<Problem
title="Taming the Tuple"
difficulty={4}
relevance={4}
source="Leo Schmidt-Traub"
>
<div label="question">
In the script, you are told that the tuple $(a,b)$ can be uniquely defined as the set $\{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}$. (this means that for any tuples $t_1$ and $t_2$: $t_1=t_2\iff S_{t_1}=S_{t_2}$, where $S_{t_1},S_{t_2}$ are the corresponding sets)

For an arbitrary set $A$, we define $A^*=\bigcup\limits_{n=1}^\infty A^n$ as the set of finite sequences in $A$ (where $A^n=\times_{i=1}^n A$).

Find a way of uniquely defining each element of $A^*$ as a set and prove its correctness. (this set should only be made up of elements of $A$, or nested sets containing elements of $A$) 

You are **not** allowed to assume that the set definition of a tuple shown in the script is adequate, and you are welcome to use a different definition.

## Week 6
<Problem
title="Bi(t)jection"
difficulty={4}
relevance={3}

<div label="question">

The goal of this exercise is to show that the set of all real numbers between 0 and 1, denoted $[0, 1]$, is uncountable.

In this week's lectures, you encountered the set $\{0, 1\}^{\infty}$ of semi-infinite bitstrings. Cantor's diagonalization argument proves that this set is uncountable.

Through a slight modification of Cantor's diagonalization argument, one can also prove that the set of real numbers $[0, 1]$ is uncountable. However, this exercise prohibits you from using that method.

Instead, use Theorem 3.16 (Bernsteinâ€“SchrÃ¶der theorem) to show $[0, 1] \sim \{0, 1\}^{\infty}$, i.e., provide a bijection between these two sets to prove they are equinumerous. Then, conclude that $[0, 1]$ must be uncountable.

<div label="question">
For any $n\in\mathbb N\setminus\{0\}$ and $k\in\{1,\ldots,n\}$, find a relation $\rho$ on $A=\{1,\ldots, n\}$ satisfying $\rho^k=\rho$ and $\rho^i\neq\rho^j\forall i,j\in\{1,\ldots,k-1\},i\neq j$.

Thinking of the graph- and matrix-representations of $\rho$ might help.
